To do
1) Add Season class that has 162 games, lineup
2) Maybe make a new Innings class to represent an inning
3) Baserunning based on real player data
4) Error potential.  Sacrifce potential.  Baserunner movement on bbo potential
5) Add pitchers to the mix
6) Figure out why runs are about 1 run/game too high!  (or maybe it's valid?)
