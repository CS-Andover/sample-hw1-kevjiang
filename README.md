Markov Model Explanation: http://www.pankin.com/markov/btn1191.htm

To do
3) Baserunning based on real player data
4) Steal potential.
5) Error potential.  
6) Sacrifce potential.  
7) Baserunner movement on bbo potential
8) Add pitchers to the mix
9) Figure out why runs are about 1 run/game too high!  (or maybe it's valid?)

maybe not to do
a) maybe add lineup class? but probably not
b) Maybe make a new Innings class to represent an inning
