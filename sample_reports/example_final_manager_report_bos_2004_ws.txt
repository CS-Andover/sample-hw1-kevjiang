Manager Report: Optimal Lineups

To the Manager:

	As you know, in the sport of baseball, you must make a decision on how to order the nine hitters in a lineup.  Much has been written and researched about this topic throughout the past century.  You likely have heard a lot of "conventional lineup wisdom" which suggests various rules of thumb, such as placing the fastest hitter as the leadoff man (1st), the best power hitter as the cleanup hitter (4th), or the highest average hitter in the 3rd spot.

	The bad news is that the "conventional lineup wisdom" of old is based largely on "gut feelings", which do not necessarily result in winning lineup combinations.  While conventional wisdom may be smart to follow loosely, it is perhaps easy to see that monolithic advice such as "place the highest average hitter in the 3rd spot" without considering other variables such as the composition of the rest of the lineup is a sub-optimal lineup-building approach.  The good news is that you, as the manager, need not follow outdated, data-blind rules when setting your lineup-- instead, by following the lineup suggestions in this report, you can construct a lineup to be as close to optimal as possible.

	I am well aware that the batting order is not constructed in a vacuum-- that is, you as a manager have player egos to manage and as such will be "forced" through external, social factors to bat certain players at certain positions.  This is why this report offers, in addition to the five most optimal lineup combinations, a detailed analysis of which positions a player should bat to optimize lineup performance.  Thus, you as a manager will be able to make an informed decision balancing the various pressures of managing a clubhouse with constructing a lineup that offers the maximum number of runs per game.

	Our data driven approach will simulate full 162-game seasons of baseball using a baseball simulation engine.  Seasons will be simulated using different permutations of a 9-person batting lineup, and the runs/game from each season will be recorded, processed, and evaluated to find 1) optimal batting positions for each player and 2) the top 5 optimal lineups.  Player historical statistics will be used as an input as an estimate of future performance-- that is, our report generates optimal lineup data assuming that players will play to their previously statistical ability.  However, if you suspect a player's abilities have significantly deviated from their historical performance, it would be easy to add these new observations by altering the statistical data contained in the input csv files to our simulation engine (or ask your resident computer/data science professional to change these values for you).

	If you are short on time, below are 5 of the optimal lineups based on maximizing runs/game that appeared in our simulations.  In addition to runs/game data, we have also included the statistical output of each player during that season, which should give you a sense of how each player fared in our simulated season.  This data is included because the variance in baseball, even in a 162-game season, can be admittedly high-- thus, if you notice that a player over-performed or under-performed in the season in question, you can adjust your lineup evaluations accordingly.  Regardless, using one of these lineup combinations in real MLB games should allow for a relatively optimal performance.

	Note: This report was generated using 16200 Monte Carlo simulations of 162-game seasons.

	TLDR: pick one of these lineups for your optimal lineup combination:

	If you are willing to dig deeper into the data, this report also provides a more holistic evaluation of player viability at different positions. Below is a table that displays the average runs per game of a lineup containing a given player at a given batting position (i.e. the average number of runs per game generated when player X batted in the ith spot in the lineup).  

	Using this table provided, you will be able to judge how many runs per game an average lineup with a particular player at a particular position will produce.  Each player has batting positions that result in lineups that produce more runs; likewise, every player has batting positions that result in lineups that produce fewer runs.  The key for you as a manager is to place as many players in their "optimal" batting positions as possible, in order to produce an optimally performing lineup.  However, it is also important to note that this data is based on an "average" lineup-- thus, you should also refer to the 5 optimal lineups for a good idea of optimal orderings in which to place your players, and balance the two pieces of information in addition to other external, social pressures accordingly.

	Finally, in lieu of the "conventional lineup wisdom" of old, this report has generated a data driven lineup cheat sheet, which will provide the top 3 lineup positions for each player based on these Monte Carlo simulations.  Note that it may not be possible to place all players in their "best" position (since one player's optimal position in a lineup could feasibly be the same as another player's optimal position in a lineup).  However, you should try your best to place a player in one of their three most optimal batting positions.

Kevin Millar                	Best: 2	Better: 6	Good: 3

	A caveat: it is important to note that, due to the high variance of the sport of baseball and the nature of Monte Carlo simulations, subsequent reports generated by our baseball engine may produce slightly different results.  It is important to run an adequately high number of simulations (we suggest >1000 total different seasons as a starting point, but really the more simulations run the more accurate the data will be) for a more complete report.  If you suspect that some of the optimal lineups were flukes, that's ok!  In fact, that's why this report includes five optimal lineups in addition to the statistics of each player in those lineups-- due diligence on your part as a manager should be able to weed out any aggregiously anamolous player performances using the data provided in this report.
